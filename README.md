# odin-recipes
This project is a recipe book and will utilize HTML.

Reflection:
This project was quite easy to implement. It was basic HTML and adding 3 recipes was simple using Wikipedia 
and Allrecipes. Additionally I learned better folder and file management, which streamlined the process.
It makes sense having all these directories and keeping index.html at the root, when it comes to publication.
I will now make a grilled cheese following this submission!
