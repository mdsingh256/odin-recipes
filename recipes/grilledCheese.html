    <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            A grilled cheese is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by placing cheese between slices of bread 
            and cooking with butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread 
            browns and the cheese melts. Despite its name, it is rarely prepared through grilling.
