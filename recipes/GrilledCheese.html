<h2>Description:</h2>
<p> 
    A grilled cheese sandwich is a classic comfort food made by grilling two slices of bread with melted cheese between them until the bread is crispy and golden brown and the cheese is hot and gooey. It's simple, delicious, and often paired with a bowl of tomato soup for a perfect meal.
